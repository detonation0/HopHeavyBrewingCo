								My name is Maxwell Brown and I am 25 years old. I currently work as a Store Manager for Starbucks Coffee Company in Concord, Ca since 2011. While I enjoy most craft beers my favorites are definitely IPA's. Some of my favorite breweries are Stone Brewing Company, Russian River Brewing Company and Heretic Brewing Company. My wife, Rochelle, and I have started this business together in hopes of creating a legacy for our family. We had our first child in November of 2015 and want to make this a family-oriented business.

							<h2 class="major">Where did Hop Heavy Begin?</h2>
							<p>Over the past few years, we have developed a passion for brewing craft beer. It all started in 2012 when we brewed our first batch on the stove in our first home. It was a copycat recipe of Pliny the Elder from Russian River Brewing Company. Russian River, along with Dogfish Head and Stone Brewing Company is where our inspiration and passion for brewing craft beer came from. As time progressed, brewing beer with a tiny starter kit was not enough. We eventually built our own brew stand in order to brew bigger batchs easier in our garage. By August of 2014, we decided it was time to build a brewery and make a name for ourselves. That's when Hop Heavy came to life. With the help of family and friends the brewery construction is now complete. It is located inside the back half of our garage. The entire build took just under a year, starting with the framing of the actual room, to construction, to completion. To see the entire process of our build, please check out our page on Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hopheavybrewing/" target="_blank">here</a>.
			                <br>
			                <br>
			                During this time, we also became active members of a home brewers club in the Bay Area, Club DOZE and members of the Home Brewers Association and Craft Brewers Assocation. We have consistently attended several events and festivals in order to increase our knowledge of the craft beer community. Events such as NCHF (Northern California Home-brewers Festival), NHC (National Home-brewers Conference), and CBC (Craft Brewers Conference). We are dedicated to perfecting our craft and making the most enjoyable craft beer.
			                <br>
			                <br>
			                Since finishing the build of the brewery, we began brainstorming how we can share our beer with the general public. We at Hop Heavy have decided to open a tap room in Concord, Ca.The craft beer community is just beginning to thrive in this area and we want to be apart of it. We want to be one of the first local home breweries to open up a tap room. Having a location close to home is very important to us. We want to be involved in our community and make the East Bay an even better place to live.
			                <br>
			                <br>
			                The type of tap room we want to open is an industrial style atmosphere while still having an inviting environment. There are many different types of places in the Bay Area for people to go and enjoy a beer. But you don't see many tap rooms that came from home-brewing. We are very excited for our future in Concord, please join us in our Craft Beer Journey.</p>
