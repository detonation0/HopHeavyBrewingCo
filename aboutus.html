                                Eric Ruff is the Head Brewer here at Hop Heavy. He’s a passionate, self-taught brewer and business owner who has always had a knack for figuring out how and why things work. As many brewers do, Eric started around three years ago brewing as a hobby with nothing but a starter kit. He took his time learning all he could from home brewing books, websites, and podcasts (Brewing Network is his favorite) to hone his technique. From the knowledge he gained, he quickly started developing his own recipes through trial and error, eventually creating some amazing brews. In 2015, his Belgian Ale won best in class at the California State Homebrew Competition. Being involved in the homebrewing community is very important to him. He is an active member of the Diablo Order of Zymiracle Enthusiasts (Club DOZE) and the American Homebrewers Association (AHA) where he loves learning from others as well as sharing his knowledge. Eric and his wife Christine are excited for this opportunity to be a part of the Hop Heavy team alongside Max and Rochelle and look forward to an exciting future at Hop Heavy.

                            <h2 class="major">Where did Hop Heavy Begin?</h2>
                            <p>Over the past few years, we have developed a passion for brewing craft beer. It all started in 2012 when we brewed our first batch on the stove in our first home. It was a copycat recipe of Pliny the Elder from Russian River Brewing Company. Russian River, along with Dogfish Head and Stone Brewing Company is where our inspiration and passion for brewing craft beer came from. As time progressed, brewing beer with a tiny starter kit was not enough. We eventually built our own brew stand in order to brew bigger batches easier in our garage. By August of 2014, we decided it was time to build a brewery and make a name for ourselves. That's when Hop Heavy Brewing Co. came to life. With the help of family and friends, we built a small brewing space in our garage to start production. The entire build took just under a year starting with the framing of the actual room, to construction, to completion. To see the entire process of our build, please check out our page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hopheavybrewing/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            During this time, we also became active members of Club DOZE, the Homebrewers Association, and the Craft Brewers Association. We have consistently attended several events and festivals such as the Northern California Homebrewers Festival (NCHF), National Homebrewers Conference (NHC), and the Craft Brewers Conference (CBC) in order to increase our knowledge of the craft beer community. We are dedicated to perfecting our craft and making enjoyable craft beer.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Since finishing the build of our in-home brewing space, we began brainstorming how we can share our beer with the general public. We eventually decided to open a taproom in Concord, CA. The taproom is currently under construction and we’re looking to open its doors for the first time in June, 2016. The craft beer community is beginning to thrive in the Bay Area and we want to be apart of it. Having a location close to home is very important to us so Concord was an easy choice for location. Our goal is to be involved in our community and make the East Bay an even better place to live.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The taproom will have an industrial feel while keeping an inviting environment. There are many different options in the Bay Area for people to go and enjoy a beer, but you don't see many taprooms that derive from home brewing. We are very excited for our future in Concord. Please join us in our craft beer journey.</p>
